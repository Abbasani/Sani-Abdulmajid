        <p>Adamawa State is a state in North East Nigeria along the country's eastern border with Cameroon. The state is mainly composed of the highlands of mountains (the Atlantika, Mandara, and the Shebshi ranges) and the Adamawa Plateau crossed by valleys and rivers, most notably the Benue and Gongola rivers. It is home to the Gashaka Gumti National Park, a large wildlife park.</p>
        <p>Gashaka Gumti National Park — in Gashaka, Yola, is Nigeria’s largest national park. It has many different terrains, such as savannah grasslands, montane forests, and steep, mountainous regions. The park also contains some historic sites one of which is the pre-1918 German fort and garrison top of Gashaka Hill which was once used as a watch tower by the German military expedition to that area.

        <p>Sukur Cultural Landscape Sukur on Wikipedia is on a hill above the village of Sukur in the Adamawa State about 120 km south of Maidaguri, in the Mandara Mountains close to Nigeria/Cameroon border. It has a total area of 764.4 ha (1,889 acres). It is about 290 km from Yola. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located on a hill above the village of Sukur. Its inscription was based on the cultural heritage of the Hidi's Palace complex and village, material culture, and the naturally-terraced fields, which are in an intact condition. Sukur is Africa's first cultural landscape to receive World Heritage List inscription. Sukur is an ancient settlement with a recorded history of iron smelting technology, flourishing trade, and strong political institution dating back to the 16th century. The area has been under essentially the same form of land management for at least 400 years, under the Dur dynasty of chiefs. Local granite has been used to build terraced fields (which are invested with a spiritual significance with sacred trees and ritual sites), and defensive dry stone walls around homesteads. The area has a long tradition of iron smelting, and village architecture reflects the prevailing social hierarchy, the most prominent set of buildings being the Hidi (chief’s) Palace on a hilltop overlooking the rest of the village.</p>
